                                    <p>Fadi El Halabi is a psychotherapist and counselor for adults and couples, integrative stress management coach, trainer/facilitator, resilience and design thinking practitioner and a committed disability advocate and human rights activist. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        For the last eighteen years, Fadi has been counseling and training individuals, couples and groups and has intervened across diverse audiences - mediators, civic society activists, social workers, and private, academic and public sector audiences. 

                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        His areas of expertise include relational communication, self-care, resilience, wellness and inclusion of people with disabilities. He states that well-being starts with taking personal responsibility for ones’ life and fulfillment; the golden rule being: “The quality of our lives depends on the quality of our relationships.” His professional path in self-care and resilience culminated when he founded the “Relational Ecology Center” (REC) - first within the Antonine University (UA) in Lebanon and later as an autonomous social enterprise. 

                                    </p>

                                       The REC positions itself as an innovative ecosystem targeting educational institutions and organizations, at large. Its mission is to co-create embracing cultures that promote personal, interpersonal and community growth and fulfillment. Along his professional path, Fadi’s personal journey connected him with and increased his own resilience resources; thus, helping him achieve meaningful personal and career goals.

                            regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability,
                            physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology
                            choices. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual
                            language and imagery is not appropriate during any segment of the conference, including
                            talks, workshops, Q&As, or on Twitter and other online media.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                            Harassment includes offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression,
                            age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity,
                            religion, technology choices, deliberate intimidation, stalking, harassing, or recording,
                            sustained disruption of talks or other events, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants
                            asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately. Sponsors and
                            speakers are also subject to the anti-harassment policy.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                            If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organisers may take any
                            action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender, or expulsion from the event
                            with no refund.
